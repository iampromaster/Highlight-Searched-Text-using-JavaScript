        meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls deified among the tiers of
        shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog
        on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the
        cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in
        the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and
        small boats.</p>
